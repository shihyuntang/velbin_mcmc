class BinaryFit(object):
    """When called computes the log-likelihood of reproducing a set of observed radial velocities.

    The call takes 3 parameters, the mean velocity, velocity dispersion, and binary fraction of the cluster. These parameters can be varied to maximize the log-likelihood using any optmization routines (see scipy.optimize) or can be used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulations (e.g. pymc, emcee).

    Properties (all of these are correctly set during initialization):
    - `velocity`: observed radial velocities in km/s (in the multi-epoch case contains the weighted means of the seemingly single stars).
    - `sigvel`: measurement uncertainties of the observed radial velocities in km/s (in the multi-epoch case this will be set to one, as the measurement uncertainties has already been taken into account in pbin).
    - `mass`: best mass estimate of the observed stars in solar masses (in the multi-epoch case this will be set to one, as the mass has already been taken into account in pbin).
    - `vbin`: velocity edges of the bins (in km/s) over which `pbin` was computed.
    - `pbin`: the probability distribution of the radial velocity offset due to binary orbital motions. The probability (defined per km/s) to have a velocity between vbin[i] and vbin[i + 1] is given by pbin[i]. In the single-epoch case this will be a single 1-dimensional array for a generic mass of 1 solar masses. In the multi-epoch case this will be a 2-dimensional array containing the probability distribution for every seemingly single star (given the observations of the star).
    - `pdet_single`: For all seemingly single stars: the probability that a binary would have been detected if the star is a binary (0 for the single-epoch case).
    - `pdet_rvvar`: For all stars with detected radial velocity variability: the probability that a binary would have been detected if the star is a binary (empy array for the single-epoch case).
    - `is_single`: Boolean array marking which stars are single.
